# TBD's Challenge: Known Customer Credentials

<SponsorDetails sponsor={sponsors.find((s) => s.key === "tbd")} />

### Overview

[tbDEX](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/tbdex/) is an open messaging protocol that enables liquidity seekers to connect with liquidity providers. This means that as a liquidity provider, your business can be the backend supplier in several payment applications.

Performing KYC on repeat customers every time they attempt to transact with you from a different payment app would be a pain. To avoid this, you will use the[ Web5 SDK](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/) to issue a[ Known Customer Credential](https://github.com/TBD54566975/known-customer-credential) (KCC) to a customer, Alice, who you have already completed KYC on. You will store the JWT representing the KCC in Alice’s [Decentralized Web Node](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-web-nodes/what-are-dwns) so that she can present it to your business from any payment app.

### Challenge

1. Create a Decentralized Identifier (DID) and DWN to use as the Issuer.
   1. Bonus: Use the DIF community DWN instance hosted by Google Cloud.
2. Issue Alice a KCC that includes `evidence`. Note that for this challenge, you do not need to implement an actual identity verification flow.
3. Install the [VC Protocol](https://vc-to-dwn.tbddev.org/vc-protocol) onto your DWN so that you can communicate with Alice’s DWN.
4. Obtain permission to write to Alice’s DWN by sending a GET request to https://vc-to-dwn.tbddev.org/authorize?issuerDid=${issuerDidUri}
5. Store the VC JWT of the KCC as a private record in Alice’s DWN.

### Submission Requirements

For this challenge, only the DWN Record ID of the KCC is required for submission. To work around the DevPost submission process, do the following:

- Enter the DWN Record ID of the KCC in the "Please provide a written description of how DIDs and VCs were used" field
- Enter "N/A" into the other required fields labeled:
  - "Include a text description that should explain the features and functionality of your project."
- Enter a placeholder URL such as `https://example.com` into the other required fields labeled:
  - "Provide a URL to your public code repository."
  - "Include a 3 minute demonstration video of your project."
